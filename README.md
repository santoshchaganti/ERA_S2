# üîç Psoriasis Food Scout

## Project Motivation

The idea is to develop a AI based mobile application on psoriasis food analysis. For psoriasis patients, it is important to know which foods are good for them and which are not. As a proof of concept, an AI-powered web application that helps individuals with psoriasis make informed dietary choices by analyzing food images and providing personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Upload food images for instant AI-powered analysis
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model for intelligent food assessment
- **Psoriasis-Specific Guidance**: Categorizes foods as GOOD ‚úÖ, MODERATE ‚ö†Ô∏è, or BAD ‚ùå for psoriasis management
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides scientific reasoning behind each recommendation
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Offers healthier alternatives for problematic foods
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, user-friendly interface that works on all devices
- **Cloud Deployment**: Ready-to-deploy on AWS with Terraform infrastructure

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Take a photo or upload an image of food
2. **Analyze**: AI examines the food for inflammatory properties and psoriasis triggers
3. **Receive**: Get categorized recommendations with detailed explanations
4. **Act**: Make informed dietary choices based on evidence-based advice

### Rating System

- **‚úÖ GOOD**: Anti-inflammatory foods that may help reduce psoriasis symptoms
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE**: Neutral foods that should be consumed mindfully
- **‚ùå BAD**: Pro-inflammatory foods that may trigger psoriasis flares

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Google Gemini API key
- uv (Python package manager)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd psoriasis_food_scout
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Cloud Deployment

### AWS Deployment with Terraform

The project includes complete Terraform configuration for AWS deployment.

#### Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed
- AWS CLI configured

#### Deploy to AWS

1. **Set up Terraform variables**
   ```bash
   # Create terraform.tfvars file
   cat << EOF > terraform.tfvars
   gemini_api_key = "your_gemini_api_key"
   aws_access_key = "your_aws_access_key"
   aws_secret_key = "your_aws_secret_key"
   aws_region = "us-east-1"
   key_pair_name = "psoriasis-app-key"
   vpc_id = "your_vpc_id"
   EOF
   ```

2. **Initialize and deploy**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Access deployed application**
   The application will be available on the created EC2 instance at port 5000.
